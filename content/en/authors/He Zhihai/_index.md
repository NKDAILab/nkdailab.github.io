Before returning to China full-time in 2021, he worked for 18 years in the Department of Electronic Engineering at the University of Missouri in the United States (2003-2021). Before leaving, he was a tenured full professor in the department and a chair professor at Robert Lee Tatum. In 2001, he obtained a doctoral degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. Since 2003, long-term and in-depth cutting-edge research has been conducted on artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and Smart Cyber Physical Systems. I have been engaged in research on multimedia communication, machine vision, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence for a long time. The research results have been successfully applied in fields such as intelligent manufacturing, intelligent elderly care, intelligent transportation, ecological environment, remote special education and training. We have undertaken over ten key research projects from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DOD), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), with a total funding of over 25 million US dollars.
