        <p style="font-size:20px">Implemented a smart elderly care model based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-driven data analysis, leading to the generation of disease warnings. The research indicates that, within 2-4 weeks of disease onset, signs and patterns of common elderly diseases can be identified through the analysis of sensor data.
