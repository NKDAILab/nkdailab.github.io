        <p style="font-size:20px">The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), led by Professor Zhihai He, focuses on research areas such as intelligent sensor design, computer vision, multimodal perception of human behavior; big data intelligent analysis, machine learning, data fusion, and data mining; large-scale data visualization; physiological function assessment; fall detection; AI disease monitoring and early warning. The research team comprises 1 postdoctoral researcher, 5 Ph.D. students, 9 master's students, and 6 undergraduate students.The SUSTech Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is dedicated to structured spatial reasoning and next-generation deep learning; networked distributed deep learning for the Internet of Things (IoT); and research on deep intelligent human-computer interaction systems. This includes the development of models for smart elderly care based on IoT and sensor-driven data analysis, leading to disease prediction and warning.

        <p style="font-size:20px">Implemented a smart elderly care model based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-driven data analysis, leading to the generation of disease warnings. The research indicates that, within 2-4 weeks of disease onset, signs and patterns of common elderly diseases can be identified through the analysis of sensor data.
