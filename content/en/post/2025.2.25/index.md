Initiated by the Chinese Society for Artificial Intelligence, the Wu Wenjun Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology Award, known as ‘China's Highest Prize for Intelligent Science and Technology’, is a symbol of the highest honour in the field of artificial intelligence. The award aims to recognise units and individuals who have made key discoveries in AI research, promoted scientific and technological progress, and created significant economic and social benefits or ecological and environmental benefits.

Professor He Zhihai, together with Professor Cao Wenming of Shenzhen University, Professor Cen Yigang of Beijing Jiaotong University, and Senior Research Scholar Ouyang Jian of the Southern University of Science and Technology, jointly declared the achievement of ‘Big Model-Driven Home AI Doctor and Total Disease Management’, which is an innovative use of AI and big model technology to build a set of products that cover the following areas: home health and disease monitoring, analytical modelling, analysis and modelling, and home health and disease management. It innovatively uses artificial intelligence and big model technology to build a comprehensive platform covering home health and disease monitoring, analysis and modelling, early warning and intervention, diagnosis and treatment assistance, as well as chronic disease prevention and control management. The platform greatly empowers healthcare professionals to provide professional and intelligent health monitoring and disease management services for elderly patients with chronic diseases in the home environment, effectively solving the health monitoring and disease management problems brought about by aging.
