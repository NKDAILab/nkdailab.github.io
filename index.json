With the rapid development of multimodal AI technology, how to make the model achieve cross-modal (e.g., image-text) efficient learning under a very small number of labelled samples has become a key challenge. Existing methods generally face bottlenecks such as high risk of overfitting, high consumption of computational resources, and insufficient cross-modal alignment capability. The research team innovatively introduces the second-order God’s frequent differential equation into the cross-modal learning framework, enhances the model expression ability through continuous dynamic feature optimisation, and combines the ‘text-as-image’ data enhancement strategy to effectively expand the training data by using the graphic-text correlation feature of CLIP model. Experiments show that the classification accuracy of this method on 11 benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet, is significantly better than that of the existing optimal method for small samples, and shows potential application in data-scarce scenarios, such as medical images.

Our approach begins by constructing a universal image feature dictionary using a multi-stage approach involving modified spatial pyramid pooling, dimension reduction, and multi-scale feature clustering. For each input image, we learn to synthesize a conditioning latent by selecting and synthesizing relevant features from the dictionary, which significantly enhances the model's capability in capturing and exploring image source correlation. This conditional latent synthesis involves a correlation-based feature matching and alignment strategy, comprising a Conditional Latent Matching (CLM) module and a Conditional Latent Synthesis (CLS) module. The synthesized latent is then used to guide the encoding process, allowing for more efficient compression by exploiting the correlation between the input image and the reference dictionary. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed conditional latent coding (CLC) method is robust to perturbations in the external dictionary samples and the selected conditioning latent, with an error bound that scales logarithmically with the dictionary size, ensuring stability even with large and diverse dictionaries. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our new method improves the coding performance by a large margin (up to 1.2 dB) with a very small overhead of approximately 0.5% bits per pixel.","tags":null,"title":"Conditional Latent Coding with Learnable Synthesized Reference for Deep Image Compression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Zhang","Chun-Wun Cheng","Junyi He","Zhihai He","Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb","Yuyan Chen","Angelica I Aviles-Rivero"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1738368000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1738368000,"objectID":"ad6f4fbd188eb71df522a0c719bd5f77","permalink":"https://nkdailab.github.io/publication/cross-modal-few-shot-learning-with-second-order-neural-ordinary-differential-equations/","publishdate":"2025-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cross-modal-few-shot-learning-with-second-order-neural-ordinary-differential-equations/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce SONO, a novel method leveraging Second-Order Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Second-Order NODEs) to enhance cross-modal few-shot learning. By employing a simple yet effective architecture consisting of a Second-Order NODEs model paired with a cross-modal classifier, SONO addresses the significant challenge of overfitting, which is common in few-shot scenarios due to limited training examples. Our second-order approach can approximate a broader class of functions, enhancing the model's expressive power and feature generalization capabilities. We initialize our cross-modal classifier with text embeddings derived from class-relevant prompts, streamlining training efficiency by avoiding the need for frequent text encoder processing. Additionally, we utilize text-based image augmentation, exploiting CLIP's robust image-text correlation to enrich training data significantly. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SONO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning performance.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning with Second-Order Neural Ordinary Differential Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ce Zhang","Siqi Wu","Zhihai He","Zhao Joy Sun"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1699142400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699142400,"objectID":"7c7fd8c8f4e3f2caee39c18a64959b9e","permalink":"https://nkdailab.github.io/publication/critical-sampling-for-data-driven-modeling-of-unknown-dynamical-systems/","publishdate":"2023-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/critical-sampling-for-data-driven-modeling-of-unknown-dynamical-systems/","section":"publication","summary":"When a robot is exploring an unknown dynamical system, we often face the following important question:what is the minimum number of samples needed for effective learning of its governing laws and accurate prediction of its future evolution behavior, and how to select these critical samples? In this work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach. Starting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical samples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution.

When CLIP is used for depth estimation tasks, the patches, divided from the input images, can be combined with a series of semantic descriptions of the depth information to obtain similarity results. The coarse estimation of depth is then achieved by weighting and summing the depth values, called depth bins, corresponding to the predefined semantic descriptions. The zero-shot approach circumvents the computational and time-intensive nature of traditional fully-supervised depth estimation methods. However, this method, utilizing fixed depth bins, may not effectively generalize as images from different scenes may exhibit distinct depth distributions. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot-based method which learns to adapt the VLMs for monocular depth estimation to balance training costs and generalization capabilities. Specifically, it assigns different depth bins for different scenes, which can be selected by the model during inference. Additionally, we incorporate learnable prompts to preprocess the input text to convert the easily human-understood text into easily model-understood vectors and further enhance the performance.

It is one of the fundamental computer vision tasks which plays an important role in a variety of downstream applications, such as motion capture, activity recognition and person tracking. With the advent of the XR era, technologies such as virtual reality (VR), human-computer interaction (HCI), and augmented reality (AR) have gradually matured. As a core part in XR research, it is becoming more and more important to reach accurate estimation of human pose. However, due to free-style motion of human bodies, for complex scenes with person-person occlusions, large variations of appearance and texture, and cluttered backgrounds, pose estimation remains very challenging.\nAuthored researchers and journal details Chair Professor Zhihai He’s team from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2022), a top conference in computer vision with the proceedings published by Springer Science+Business Media, entitled “Self-Constrained Inference Optimization on Structural Groups for Human Pose Estimation.”\nFindings \u0026amp; Conclusion Prof. He’s team observed that human poses exhibit strong group-wise structural correlation and spatial coupling between keypoints due to the biological constraints of different body parts. Based on this observation, researchers propose to partition the body keypoints into structural groups. Within each group, the keypoints are further partitioned into two subsets, proximal keypoints with high estimation accuracy and low-accuracy distal keypoints. This group-wise structural correlation can be explored to improve the accuracy and robustness of human pose estimation. Figure 1. Illustration of the proposed idea of self-constrained inference optimization of structural groups for human pose estimation.\nOne fundamental challenge in pose estimation, as well as in generic prediction tasks, is that there is no mechanism for us to verify if the obtained pose estimation or prediction results are accurate or not, since the ground truth is not available. Prof. He’s team developed a self-constrained prediction-verification network to perform forward and backward predictions between these keypoint subsets. In Figure 2, This prediction-verification network with a forward-backward prediction loop learns the internal structural correlation between the proximal keypoints and the distal keypoint. The learning process is guided by the self-constraint loss. If the internal structural correlation is successfully learned, then the self-constraint loss generated by the forward and backward prediction loop should be small. This step is referred to as self-constrained learning. Figure2. The overall framework of the proposed network.\nOnce successfully learned, the verification network serves as an accuracy verification module for the forward pose prediction. During the inference stage, it can be used to guide the local optimization of the pose estimation results of low-accuracy keypoints with the self-constrained loss on high-accuracy keypoints as the objective function. This provides an effective mechanism to iteratively refine the prediction result based on the specific statistics of the test sample. This step is referred to as self-constrained optimization. Such feedback-based adaptive prediction will result in better generalization capability on the test sample.\nThe comparison and ablation experiments are performed on MS COCO dataset and CrowdPose dataset, both of which contain very challenging scenes for pose estimation such as multi-person poses of various body scales and occlusion patterns. The proposed method outperforms the current best by a large margin, up to 2.5% on MS COCO dataset. On CrowdPose dataset, it has improved the pose estimation accuracy by up to 1.5%, which is quite significantly. Visualization results in Figure 3 also demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the pose estimation results. Figure 3. Three examples of refinement of predicted keypoints.
