      <p>AAAI, short for The Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, is one of the most important international conferences in the field of Artificial Intelligence, hosted by the International Association for Artificial Intelligence, and recommended by the Chinese Computer Federation (CCF) as a Class A conference. AAAI AAAI 2025 received 12,957 submissions and 3032 papers were accepted, with an acceptance rate of 23.4%, of which the Oral Presentation acceptance rate was 4.6%.AAAI 2025 was held on 25 February - 4 March 2025 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.</p>
<p><strong><u>《Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning with Second-Order Neural Ordinary Differential Equations》</u></strong></br></p>
<p><strong><u>Authors</u></strong></br>
Yi Zhang (Harbin Institute of Technology, Southern University of Science and Technology), Chun-Wun Cheng (University of Cambridge), Junyi He (Southern University of Science and Technology), Zhihai He (Southern University of Science and Technology), Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb (University of Cambridge), Yuyan Chen (Fudan University), Angelica I Aviles-Rivero (Tsinghua University)</p>
<p><strong><u>Brief introduction</u></strong></br>
Yi Zhang, a PhD student in the class of 2021 at the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, proposes an innovative method SONO in the field of cross-modal small-sample learning, which significantly improves the model&rsquo;s generalisation ability in few-sample scenarios through second-order God-frequent differential equations, and effectively solves the overfitting problem due to the scarcity of data in the traditional method.
With the rapid development of multimodal AI technology, how to make the model achieve cross-modal (e.g., image-text) efficient learning under a very small number of labelled samples has become a key challenge. Existing methods generally face bottlenecks such as high risk of overfitting, high consumption of computational resources, and insufficient cross-modal alignment capability. The research team innovatively introduces the second-order God&rsquo;s frequent differential equation into the cross-modal learning framework, enhances the model expression ability through continuous dynamic feature optimisation, and combines the ‘text-as-image’ data enhancement strategy to effectively expand the training data by using the graphic-text correlation feature of CLIP model. Experiments show that the classification accuracy of this method on 11 benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet, is significantly better than that of the existing optimal method for small samples, and shows potential application in data-scarce scenarios, such as medical images.

<p><strong><u>《Conditional Latent Coding with Learnable Synthesized Reference for Deep Image Compression》</u></strong></br></p>
<p><strong><u>Authors</u></strong></br>
Siqi Wu (University of Missouri), Yinda Chen (University of Science and Technology of China), Dong Liu (University of Science and Technology of China), Zhihai He (Southern University of Science and Technology)</p>
<p><strong><u>Brief introduction</u></strong></br>
Siqi Wu, a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, USA, class of 2022, has proposed a conditional latent coding method based on learnable synthetic references to improve the efficiency of deep image compression in collaboration with the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) during his visit to Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) as a visiting researcher.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of digital technology and the dramatic increase in the amount of image data, efficient image compression techniques are crucial for storing, transmitting and processing image data. Current deep learning methods have made significant progress in image compression, but still face the challenge of effectively exploiting image source correlation while maintaining high reconstruction quality. The article proposes a conditional latent coding method to conditionally encode the input image by dynamically generating a reference representation from an external dictionary. The input image will be matched with the features in the dictionary to exploit the correlation between the input image and the reference dictionary in order to achieve efficient compression and high quality reconstruction of the input image. This thesis achieves a large enhancement on the publicly available datasets Kodak and CLIC, providing useful insights for further research and potential improvements.
